# Python Robotics Curriculum (Youngstown RC Club Edition)

Welcome to the official 36-week Python Robotics Curriculum! This program was designed to support RC hobbyists, students, and makers in learning how to use Python, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and real-world sensors through structured weekly projects.

## 📋 Overview

This curriculum is broken down into 36 weekly lessons. Each week includes a clear topic focus, resources for learning, and optional project expansions for deeper engagement. It is ideal for:

- RC Club participants
- STEM educators
- Hobbyist programmers and tinkerers
- Families exploring tech together

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Python programming fundamentals
- Hardware control using Arduino and Raspberry Pi
- Real-time sensor data collection
- GUI and web-based control dashboards
- Project documentation and GitHub publishing
- Practical STEM project design and execution

## 📁 Curriculum Format

The curriculum is available in CSV format:  
➡️ [Python_Robotics_Curriculum_for_GitHub.csv](./Python_Robotics_Curriculum_for_GitHub.csv)

Each row includes:
- **Week number**
- **Topic/Focus**
- **Resources or notes** (including links or book references)

## 🔧 Manual Updates
